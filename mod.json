It's multiplayer supported since it's best used in Multiplayer.\n\nContains plenty of items with varying attributes, the ability to SEARCH for items, and has an MP system. Best used as a utility for RPs.\n\nI decided to push out early v1.5, so some features are experimental, but none should be so to a fault.\n\n[stat]Requires [#00aaff]DeltaNedas/ui-lib[].",
